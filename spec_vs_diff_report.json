  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive institutional corporate website for Quindore Holdings LLC covering all major requirements: global theme, header, hero, about, operating structure, compliance/governance, contact, footer, structure page, governance page, privacy/terms/legal pages, and responsive design. The implementation is largely complete and aligned with the build request. A few minor concerns exist around the logo lockup asset usage (only the monogram is used, not the full wordmark lockup image), the section padding minimum (7rem ~112px, slightly under the 120px minimum specified), and the fade-in being implemented via JavaScript IntersectionObserver rather than pure CSS. No major hallucinated features were found beyond boilerplate auth infrastructure.",
